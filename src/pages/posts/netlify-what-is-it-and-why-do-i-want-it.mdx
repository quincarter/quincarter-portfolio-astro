Hi there, I am Quin Carter. I am a Lead Software Engineer at Capital One, a husband, a father, and a doggy dad. Take a moment to get to know who I am as a person.

# Personal Life

In my personal life, I love to do a lot of different things, usually with technology. If there is a power source associated with a device, I am probably tinkering with it to understand how it works, or how to integrate it into my life.

## Interests

Speaking of, I have many interests outside of my daily job: 

### Coffee

This is probably my favorite thing outside of code. Coffee. I love coffee. I am a bit of a coffee snob, and have been known to scoff at the average Starbucks drinker for lack of taste. I own just about every coffee contraption known to man, and love to try different local coffee roasters wherever I go when I travel. Food binds people together, but coffee forages reltionships stronger than a burger can.

### Home Automation

<img src="/assets/images/home-assistant-logo.svg" style="height: 10rem; display: flex; place-self: center" alt="home assistant logo" />

This one is a fun topic. I have been known to rattle on for hours about Home Automation. I have spent the better part of the last 6 years or so completely automating my entire house with <a href="https://home-assistant.io" target="_blank">home-assistant.io</a>. This free/open source software links together all of your smart devices in your house (no matter what platform you are on), and gives you a whole interface to customize your smart life how you need it. If you have any questions, I can literally talk to any stranger about home automation and I absolutely love it.

### Movies/TV

Movies and TV is kind of a cliche to say that you like them these days. To be more specific, I love Star Wars, Marvel, and a decent chick flick with my wife every once in a while. TV Shows are where the most interesting things happen in my opinion. There is so much more character development and structure to it; you develop a relationship with the characters over x number of seasons.

## Travel
Life is all about experiences, right? We have a saying my family that we want to make the most of our lives, however short they are, and travel as much as possible. I am proud to say that I have been to almost every state in the United States, Mexico, England, and Greece, with more planned in the future. I did not get to travel out of the country much as a child and I definitely want to do more of that in my adult life, and give my daughter those experiences to cherish later in her life.

# Life as Coffee Snob/Software Engineer
My overall career has been an interesting one. I started in IT Supporting Cash Register hardware in my earlier career, only to find out that I really enjoyed the software behind the hardware. I entered my engineering career in a school district in the Dallas/Fort Worth area as a web developer/database developer. I quickly realized I loved the work and wanted more. 

I have spent my time in my dev career as a full stack developer, but I fell in love with Frontend when I worked at a company called Hilti. We were doing very interesting things with Angular back in the day. These problems we were solving related to performance, design, and overall Frontend technology and health made me intrigued by the end-user experience challenges and the solutions we can build to make them scalable and performant on any browser. 

That last piece was probably the thing that tickled my brain the most: 
> overall Frontend technology and health made me intrigued by the end-user experience challenges and the solutions we can build to make them scalable and performant on any browser. 

Every browser and every device isn't the same. You have multiple devices running on many operating systems with different renders. At the time, the web was not just Chromium and Firefox. There is/was Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge (pre chromium). These challenges were very interesting to try to solve for and ultimately helped me find solutions in today's world of frontend engineering on the web.

## Day to Day
My day-to-day at Capital One has been extremely fun. I have been able to focus only on Frontend technologies my entire time at Capital One over the last {new Date().getFullYear() - 2019} years. From architecting and building Angular apps (ng10 to current), to React plugins in Grafana, to Lit Element Web Components and building full scale systems internally, Capital One's frontend engineering is extremely sophisticated and bleeding edge. 

### Frontend Community Of Practice (COP)
I currently lead the Frontend COP for all of our enterprise and have led it since about 2021. We have _thousands_ of developers that are UI Curious and want to learn more about frontend technology. In the Frontend COP myself and a few others in the planning committee have created a community that thives on each other and has built amazing things together while following best practices across the enterprise. I have facilitated and presented monthly tech talks around Frontend Engineering technologies being used in the industry today to evangelize modern development practices, preventing us from being stale as a company tech-wise.

#### Speaking Engagements
I have spoken on a number of occasions on a plethora of topics:
1. CSS Grid/Flex and when to use which one
2. Ionic Framework with Angular, React, and Vue
3. Lit Element unit testing with Open WC testing and Vitest
4. Web Workers - when to use them and how do you benefit from them
5. Service Workers - How are they different from web workers?
6. Shared Workers - Aren't they just Web Workers with extra toys?
7. Nx Monorepo Management with Yarn Workspaces
8. Changesets with Nx - Publishing your packages to internal artifactory
9. Micro Frontends are not Web Components. Prove me Wrong.
10. Over-engineering you Micro Frontend architecture. A bad practice talk on anti-patterns
11. WebAssembly (WASM) - My pitfalls using it and finding resources.
12. WASM is AWSM - a full talk on my patent-pending document renderer using WASM+WebWorkers+Lit Element
13. WASM isn't Replacing JavaScript. Let me show you when to use it.
14. WASM in Blazor and why you shouldn't use Blazor
15. WASM Document Viewer as a Shareable, injectable Web Component

### Internal Hackathons
I have been the standing host of our internal hackathon in REFI for 2 years. Out of that 2 year engagement, more than 100 patents were filed as a result of the hackathon ideas, multiple ideas taken to production, and I fostered engagement and professional development outside of people's normal comfort zones by providing a safe space to innovate and create. 

I am a firm believer in what a hackathon can provide developers: a break from their normal work to revive their love in what they are doing. Many developers are burned out and just don't know how to identify it. Having a monthly hackathon that lasts 1 day can help them come back to center. This allows their brain to decompress and ultimately find new love in what they do again.
